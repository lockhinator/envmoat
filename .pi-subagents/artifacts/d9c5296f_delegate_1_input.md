# Task for delegate

Read /Users/cameronlockhart/Development/secrets-manager/PLAN.md and perform a comprehensive architecture review. Check everything: Go+CGO, shell hooks (bash regex, zsh chpwd), directory walk-up, CLI completeness including profiles and verify, file format, concurrency, atomic writes, HKDF bundle_id, marker parsing, debug mode, walk boundary, rotate two-phase, and any remaining gaps. If the plan is solid with no issues, respond with exactly "CLEAN — no architecture issues found." If issues remain, list them specifically.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: checked
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:

Required evidence: changed-files, tests-added, commands-run, residual-risks, no-staged-files

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
